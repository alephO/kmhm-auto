# kmhm-auto
This project is designed to be an automated tool for a browser game. To make this less detectable, it uses PyChromeDevTools and remote debug feature of the Chrome developer tools, which should be totally transparent to the server. This is at the cost of consuming more time and resources than light-weight browser/package solutions.

It is still being developed, uploaded for my own record.
